SpriteKitFun
============

These demos were used my *Fun SpriteKit Tricks to Impress Your Friends* presentation for the [Atlanta iOS Developers April Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/iosatlanta/events/170723732/).

Each branch contains a different demo:

  * **battle** - A 2 player battle game where one player moves a ship and the other creates obstacles
  * **boxie** - A physics toy to create lots of animated boxes
  * **firestorm** - A simple particle emitter that follows your finger
